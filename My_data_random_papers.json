    "context": "Neutral-atom quantum computing (NAQC) offers distinct advantages such as dynamic qubit reconfigurability, long coherence times, and high gate fidelities, making it a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. Despite these strengths, efficiently implementing quantum circuits like the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) remains a significant challenge due to atom movement overheads and connectivity constraints. This paper introduces optimal compilation strategies tailored to QFT circuits and NAQC systems, addressing these challenges for both linear and grid-like architectures.

The rapid advancement of quantum computing research has led to the development of multiple hardware platforms, each with unique strengths and challenges. Among these, superconducting qubits have gained prominence due to their robust control schemes and compatibility with conventional microelectronics⁵. In the past several years, neutral-atom quantum computing (NAQC) has attracted significant attention for its inherent advantages, including scalability, high qubit connectivity, long coherence times, and superior gate fidelity⁶⁻⁸.\n\nIn superconducting quantum devices, such as IBM's heavy-hex architecture, qubits are sparsely arranged to minimize crosstalk. This sparse arrangement, however, requires additional routing steps (mainly through inserting SWAP gates) to facilitate operations between distant qubits. In contrast, NAQC devices, often arranged on a 2D grid, enable two-qubit gates between any two qubits by shuttling them closer. However, longer shuttling distances can increase noise levels.

    "answer": "Neutral-Atom Quantum Computing (NAQC) is a promising platform for scalable quantum computing due to its distinct advantages: dynamic qubit reconfigurability, long coherence times, high gate fidelities, scalability, and high qubit connectivity. Unlike superconducting qubit architectures, which often feature sparse qubit arrangements to minimize crosstalk, NAQC devices (typically arranged on a 2D grid) enable two-qubit gates between any two qubits by physically shuttling atoms closer. This inherent mobility eliminates the need for costly SWAP gates, which are commonly required in fixed-architecture superconducting devices to facilitate interactions between non-adjacent qubits. However, this unique capability of NAQC also introduces a primary compilation challenge: minimizing atom movement overhead.

    "question": "Describe the step-by-step execution procedure for Controlled-Z (CZ) gates in a Dynamically Field-Programmable Qubit Array (DPQA) architecture within Neutral-Atom Quantum Computing, including the distinct modes of the 'separate' step and their implications for atom movement.",
    "context": "2.4 Compilation Procedures in NAQC \nConsider a quantum circuit C consisting of single- and two-qubit gates that are native to a DPQA device M. In NAQC, single-qubit gates are implemented independently using Raman laser pulses and are therefore typically excluded from C when assessing the cost of atom movement. This simplification allows the problem to focus on the native two-qubit gates, which are typically CZ gates. These CZ gates are organized into layers, each of which can, in principle, be executed in parallel through global Rydberg illumination. \nInitially, each logical qubit in C is mapped to a physical atom in the DPQA device M. For each layer of parallel CZ gates, any pair of interacting qubits must be co-located at the same site (i.e., grid point) during the gate operation and separated afterward. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the execution of any CZ gate (or several CZ gates in parallel) involves the following steps: \n1. Meet: Move one or both atoms to the same site from their previous positions. \n2. Interact: Apply a global Rydberg laser to interact the qubits at the same position, executing the corresponding CZ gates in parallel. \n3. Separate: After the interaction, move the atoms apart so that they occupy different sites. \nThe execution of each CZ involves at least two atom moves: a 'meet' step and a \"separate\" step. These processes can often be parallelized across several or all gates within the same layer. The maximum distance moved during these steps determines the optimal distance required. In the DPQA device M, this maximal distance is at least d in each step, where d is the unit distance of the device. Consequently, a circuit with S layers of CZ gates requires at least 2S atom moves, covering a total distance of at least 2Sd. \nWe note that the “separate\" step is highly flexible, a flexibility that plays a crucial role in this paper. Specifically, we distinguish between two modes of this step: the “swap” mode exchanges the positions of the two interacting atoms, and the “restore\" mode, which returns the two interacting atoms to their original positions. See Figure 2 for illustrations of these modes.",
    "answer": "In a Dynamically Field-Programmable Qubit Array (DPQA) architecture, the execution of Controlled-Z (CZ) gates, which are the native two-qubit operations, is organized into layers that can be executed in parallel using global Rydberg illumination. The process involves three primary steps for each CZ gate or parallel batch of gates:\n\n1.  **Meet:** One or both atoms involved in the gate are moved from their previous physical positions to the same target grid point to enable interaction.\n2.  **Interact:** A global Rydberg laser is applied, causing the co-located qubits at the shared grid point to interact and execute the corresponding CZ gates in parallel.\n3.  **Separate:** Following the interaction, the atoms are moved apart to occupy distinct grid points.\n\nEach CZ gate execution necessitates at least two atom movements: one for the 'meet' step and one for the 'separate' step. These movements can be parallelized across multiple gates within the same layer. The maximum distance an atom moves during these steps, denoted by \\(d\\) (the unit distance of the device), dictates the optimal distance required. A circuit with \\(S\\) layers of CZ gates thus requires at least \\(2S\\) atom moves, covering a total distance of at least \\(2Sd\\).\n\nThe 'separate' step offers flexibility with two distinct modes:\n*   **Swap Mode:** The positions of the two interacting atoms are exchanged. This is particularly useful for simulating SWAP operations without additional gate overhead.\n*   **Restore Mode:** The interacting atoms are returned to their original positions prior to the 'meet' step.\n\nThis flexibility in the 'separate' step is crucial for optimizing circuit compilation by strategically minimizing atom movement overhead."

    "question": "How does the Linear Path strategy achieve optimal compilation for Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuits on a linear Neutral-Atom Quantum Computing (NAQC) architecture, and what specific steps are involved for each m-stage to minimize atom movements?",
    "context": "4.2 Optimal Transformation in a Linear DPQA Architecture \nIn this subsection, we propose an optimal transformation for QFT circuits on a linear DPQA architecture, which can be viewed as a 1 × n grid. Each grid point is represented by its coordinate P₁ = (i,0), and the unit distance between consecutive grid points is d. \nThe transformation builds on Maslov's approach for linear superconducting architectures, where SWAP gates are inserted to enable interactions between non-adjacent qubits (see Fig. 3c). In DPQA, we replace these SWAP gates with atom movements, which are more efficient. Specifically, for each m-stage (mapping stage) in Maslov's transformation, the layer of controlled-phase gates is replaced with two identical layers of CZ gates. We then perform the following steps for each m-stage: \na. First CZ-layer: \n• Move the atoms involved in the gates to the same grid point (meet step). \n• Apply the gates using a global Rydberg laser (interact step). \n• Move the atoms back to their original positions (separate step in restore mode). \nb. Second CZ-layer: \n• Move the atoms involved in the gates to the same grid point (meet step). \n• Apply the gates using a global Rydberg laser (interact step). \n• Swap the positions of the atoms (separate step in swap mode). \nThis approach ensures that all CZ gates are executed with minimal atom movements, achieving the theoretical lower bound of 4(2n-3)d. The transformation is optimal because it parallelizes movements within each m-stage and minimizes the total distance traveled by the atoms. \nMore precisely, for edges ej = (j, j + 1) with j ∈ Ek (as defined in (2)), the atom movements are performed as follows: in Step a, we move all smaller-indexed atoms towards the larger-indexed atoms and move them back; in Step b, we move all smaller-indexed atoms towards the large-indexed atoms and swap their positions. \nThe movement directions are consistent within each batch of atom movements, and each move covers only a unit distance d. This ensures that the total maximal distance traveled by the atoms is 4(2n – 3)d, which matches the theoretical lower bound. Therefore, the transformation on the linear DPQA architecture is optimal. \nAs a consequence, we have the following result: \nTheorem 1. Let M be a linear DPQA architecture of n qubits. The transformation described above for QFT-n is an optimal transformation on M. \nTo illustrate the transformation, we revisit the QFT-5 circuit. \nExample 1. The QFT-5 circuit consists of 7 m-stages and 14 layers of CZ gates. Initially, the logical qubits qi are mapped to the atom located at the grid point P₁ = (i, 0) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 4 on the linear architecture. Fig. 4 illustrates the mapping stages and movement sequences for QFT-5. \nFor example, at m-stage 3, the set of edges E3 = { (1,2), (3,4) } indicates that atom movements are performed along these edges. Specifically: \n• In the first layer of CZ gates (Step a), the atoms at P₁ and P3 are moved (along the same direction), respectively, to P2 and P4, the CZ gates are applied, and the atoms are returned to their original positions. \n• In the second layer of CZ gates (Step b), the atoms at P₁ and P3 are moved (along the same direction), respectively, to P2 and P4, the CZ gates are applied, and their positions are swapped. \nThe red edges in Fig. 4 highlight the atom movements along the edges e ∈ Ek for each m-stage k (where 0 ≤ k ≤ 6), demonstrating how the transformation achieves the theoretical lower bound on movement counts.",

    "question": "Explain the Zigzag Path strategy for optimally compiling QFT circuits on grid-like DPQA architectures, including the definition of zigzag folding, its key properties, and the atom movement procedures for each m-stage.",
    "context": "4.3 Optimal Transformation on a Grid Architecture \nWhile the linear architecture achieves minimal movement cost, it requires qubits to be arranged in a one-dimensional array, which becomes impractical for large numbers of qubits. To address this, we propose folding the linear architecture into a two-dimensional grid while preserving the efficiency of the linear transformation. This is achieved through a technique called zigzag folding, which maps the linear arrangement of qubits onto a grid in a way that maintains adjacency and enables parallel gate execution. \nDefinition 1 (Zigzag Folding). Let P be a linear DPQA architecture of n qubits 90,91,...,qn−1, and let M be a DPQA architecture with grid dimensions m₁ × m2. A zigzag folding I of P into M is an injective mapping that assigns a unique grid point (xi, yi) to each qubit qi such that: \n• Neighboring Placement: Ф(qi) is a neighbor of Ф(qi−1) in M, meaning |xi – Xi−1| + |Yi - Yi−1| = 1. \n• Alternating Direction: If qi is placed horizontally relative to qi−1, then qi+1 (if i < n − 1) is placed vertically relative to qi, and vice versa. \nA zigzag folding ensures that neighboring qubits in the linear arrangement remain adjacent on the grid, enabling efficient gate execution. By Lemma 2, the gate operations and atom movements in each m-stage correspond to either horizontal or vertical edges in the zigzag folding, allowing for parallel execution. \nTheorem 2. Let Þ be a zigzag folding of a linear DPQA architecture of n qubits into a grid DPQA architecture M. Then QFT-n has an optimal transformation on M as follows: \n1. Initially, map each qi to Þ(qi). \n2. For each m-stage k, let Ek be the set of relevant edges as specified in (2). If the edges in Ek are horizontal (vertical, resp.): \n• For the first layer of CZ gates in the m-stage, move all left (lower, resp.) atoms rightward (upward, resp.), execute the gates using a global Rydberg laser, and then separate the atoms by moving them back. \n• For the second layer of CZ gates in the m-stage, move all left (lower, resp.) atoms rightward (upward, resp.), execute the gates, and then separate the atoms by exchanging their positions. \nProof. Without loss of generality, assume that q1 is placed as the right neighbor of qo in the zigzag folding Ф. By the definition of zigzag folding, the placement of qubits alternates between horizontal and vertical directions. Consequently: \n• For even k, all edges in Ek are horizontal. \n• For odd k, all edges in Ek are vertical. \nFor each m-stage k, the transformation involves four batches of atom movements: \n• Two batches for the first layer of CZ gates (Step a). \n• Two batches for the second layer of CZ gates (Step b). \nSince all movements within a batch occur in the same direction (either horizontal or vertical), they can be performed in parallel. Furthermore, each movement covers a unit distance d, ensuring that the total distance traveled by the atoms is minimized. The maximal movement distance for the entire transformation is 4(2n – 3)d, which matches the theoretical lower bound. This is achieved because: \n• Each of the 2(2n - 3) layers of CZ gates requires two atom movements (one for the meet step and one for the separate step). \n• Each movement covers a unit distance d. \n• Movements are parallelized within each m-stage, ensuring no unnecessary overhead.",
    "answer": "The Zigzag Path strategy extends optimal QFT compilation from linear to grid-like DPQA architectures by folding the one-dimensional qubit arrangement into a two-dimensional grid. This `zigzag folding` is an injective mapping, \\(\\Phi\\), that assigns each logical qubit \\(q_i\\) to a unique grid point \\((x_i, y_i)\\) in the \\(m_1 \\times m_2\\) grid \\(M\\), maintaining two key properties:\n\n1.  **Neighboring Placement:** Adjacent qubits in the linear arrangement remain neighbors on the grid, meaning \\(|x_i - x_{i-1}| + |y_i - y_{i-1}| = 1\\).\n2.  **Alternating Direction:** The placement alternates between horizontal and vertical directions; if \\(q_i\\) is placed horizontally relative to \\(q_{i-1}\\), then \\(q_{i+1}\\) is placed vertically relative to \\(q_i\\), and vice versa.\n\nThis folding ensures that gate operations and atom movements within each m-stage correspond to either purely horizontal or purely vertical edges, allowing for efficient parallel execution.

    "context": "5.3.3 Overall Fidelity Analysis \nFig. 6c compares the overall fidelity achieved by each method, where the TLB is calculated based on four atom transfers per CZ gate. \n• Linear & Zigzag Paths achieve the highest fidelity, as their movement efficiency minimises errors from atom transfers and decoherence. \n• Enola's methods show exponentially lower fidelity, reflecting their higher movement counts and distances. \n• Atomique experiences fidelity degradation as circuit size increases, primarily due to its reliance on SWAP gates and ancilla qubits. \n• DasAtom achieves higher overall fidelity than the TLB by leveraging individually addressable Rydberg lasers and long-range interactions. Since it employs local two-qubit operations without requiring global Rydberg illumination, it avoids global Rydberg excitation error. Effectively, this is equivalent to setting fexc = 1 for DasAtom in (3). \nSince the first three terms in (3) are identical for TLB, Line and Zigzag Paths, and Enola, the overall fidelity for these compilers is predominantly determined by big move counts and cumulative movement distances. \nQuantifying Fidelity Gaps. Table 2 highlights the stark fidelity gaps in larger QFT circuits. For n = 30, Enola's fidelity is more than 180× lower than our Linear Path, while Atomique's is over 1018 × lower. At n = 50, these gaps widen dramatically to factors of 1015 and 1094, respectively, emphasizing the critical role of movement minimization in large-scale circuits. \nMeanwhile, the table suggests that with individually addressable Rydberg lasers, DasAtom's fidelity could surpass the TLB by more than 64× for QFT-30 and 106× for QFT-50. This advantage persists even when excitation error is ignored for the TLB, where DasAtom's fidelity remains nearly 10× higher for QFT-30 and over 200× higher for QFT-50.

INTRODUCTION \nQuantum computing hardware has progressed substan-tially in the last few years. Several quantum comput-ing hardware providers can relatively consistently achieve two qubit gates with more than 99% Fidelity. Under lab-oratory conditions, even 99.9% has been achieved in quite a few architectures, and at least one cloud-accessible de-vice with these remarkable fidelities does exist (Quantin-uum). This all makes it even more important to drive use cases forward. A vast amount of work has been dedicated to testing various algorithms and approaches in the last few years [1-6] and it is now all the more important to assess the state and quality of the existing ideas for use cases. \nIn this work, we want to discuss the quality and current state of some exemplary use cases using four interdepen-dent criteria: \n• Identify industry problem, \n• Transform to quantum, \n• Get the job done without the quantum computer, \n• Show quantum advantage.\"\n\n\"Apart from reviewing some important historic use cases and three use cases from our own team, we intend to add two important criteria for assessing quantum com-puting use cases. One criterion – Transform to Quantum is about the necessity to consider the step of transform-ing the actual input as you get it from an end user into the formulation required for the quantum computer. A key aspect here is that only a small subset of the prob-lem might benefit from using the quantum computer and needs to be efficently extracted from a larger problem. When evaluating the quality of current use cases, partic-ular attention should be given to the state of research and the availability of software to perform this transformation step. This step can present a significant barrier to effec-tive use case implementation if the software required to identify and extract the most relevant subproblem is not available. At the same time, it can serve as the crucial step to connect otherwise abstract quantum algorithms to real end users. \nThe second criterion we intend to add is the need to invest as much effort to solve the given problem with clas-sical computers as into the research on quantum comput-ing. We call this criteria Get the Job Done Without the Quantum Computer. Of course, scientific research often has limited ressources, so it might not always be possi-ble to fully optimize classical methods before exploring the quantum ones. Nevertheless, at some stage in the process, it's important to consider the status and avail-ability of optimized classical solutions when judging any work on a quantum use case. As an example, one of the first claims advanced for an andvantage in using quan-tum computers was based on a benchmark performed by a D-Wave quantum computer [8] versus classical CPLEX solver, a standard tool for combinatorial optimization problems. However, this example did not stand up to scrutiny in the long run, since CPLEX is not the best possible solver for the type of problem addressed by the D-Wave architecture [9]. In another recent instance, an \nimpressive large-scale simulation of spin dynamics on a quantum computer was reproduced by several groups us-ing classical computers in a matter of weeks [10]. There-fore, the question if the problem has been compared to optimized classical solvers is always quite important to assess a quantum computing use case.\"\n\n\"These four steps - Identify, Transform, Benchmark, Show Quantum Advantage (ITBQ) – are obviously also interconnected (Fig. 1). Once the relevant industry prob-lem has been identified, one needs to explore if optimized classical solvers are also available. When classical solvers are sufficient to solve the identified industry problem, the quantum advantage for the actual problem is brought into question. In particular, if this is possible for a large number of examples (for example, different molecules) for the given use case, either the scope of the existing problem needs to be revisited, or the possibility of quan-tum advantage is to be considered improbable. This demonstrates that benchmarking against optimized clas-sical solvers, particularly those utilizing problem-specific approximations, often presents a significant obstacle to finding use cases for quantum computers. But at the same time finding a classical solution to achieve a satis-factory solution has obviouly also a substantial value for any end user.\"\n\n\"On the more possitive note for quantum advantage, the possibility to find broadly applicable use cases for quantum computing can be substanially enhanced by investing efforts of transforming the original industry problem into a formulation appropriate for the quantum computer. As an example, solving differential equations is probably one of the key promising problems in ap-plications of quantum computing. It has been shown that in principle we expect quantum computers to be able to solve differential equation with an exponential speedup [11-13]. But, a differential equation is never the actual industry problem. Usually, the actual problem re-quires the solutions of a differential equation. However, at this point only a small amount of work is published on the question how to transform the actual problem \ninto the quantum computer without loosing the expected speedup. To the best of our knowledge, reference [14] is among the only studies addressing this topic directly in the context of manufacturing engineering and some work on problem-specific differential equations for ma-chine learning [15, 16]. And much more should be possi-ble.\"\n\n\"In Table I we introduce our rating for these four ITBQ criteria and provide further details how to rank the use cases to track the process towards demonstrat-ing quantum advantage. This table can be understood as a checklist and we will use the rating when describ-ing the use cases in the following chapters.\"\n\n\"The overall landscape, as highlighted in recent bench-marking studies [17], is that while industrial optimiza-tion problems are of truly exceptional practical relevance, current approaches of transforming them to quantum and benchmarking for quantum advantage remain imma-ture [18-20]. Neither a uniformally established method-ology exists to fairly demonstrate quantum edge on in-dustrially meaningful optimization tasks, nor is there full maturity in the quantum-classical software toolchain that would make real-world adoption straightforward.\"\n\n\"Despite the significant interest in applying quantum computing to industrial optimization problems, current use case studies reveal a lack of provable quantum ad-vantage, whether exponential or polynomial. While it is anticipated that quantum algorithms may offer a polyno-mial speedup, this may prove insufficient given the slow gate times associated with error-corrected quantum com-puters [21]. Recent research on the Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) problem provides at least some evi-dence, that exponential speedup could be achievable for finding approximate solutions [22]. However, it is im-portant to note that the OPI problem does not directly \nIn Table I we introduce our rating for these four ITBQ criteria and provide further details how to rank the use cases to track the process towards demonstrat-ing quantum advantage.

TWO CONTRASTING ARCHETYPES: \nINDUSTRIAL OPTIMIZATION AND ABSTRACT \nSPIN PROBLEMS \nAs the field of quantum computing matures, con-siderable attention has turned to the quest for \"quan-tum advantage\" in real-world applications.

    "answer": "The ITBQ (Identify, Transform, Benchmark, Show Quantum Advantage) framework is a four-step methodology for evaluating quantum computing use cases, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and practical real-world applications.

Without fair and rigorous benchmarking against state-of-the-art classical solvers (which may continue to improve), claims of quantum advantage can be undermined. For instance, early claims based on D-Wave quantum computers were scrutinized because the classical solver used was not the best available.\n\nOverall, while quantum computing hardware has advanced significantly, the ITBQ framework emphasizes that successfully demonstrating quantum advantage for real-world problems remains a complex and immature endeavor, particularly in areas like industrial optimization, where convincing evidence of quantum advantage is still elusive, despite the high practical relevance."

But also show a more fundamental approach about how to judge use cases and guide more projects towards quantum advantage. \nA. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance \n1. Identify industry problem \nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important analytical techniques in chem-istry. When determining or elucidating the structure of organic compounds, it is usually NMR spectroscopy that provides the majority of information, complemented by other techniques such as infrared spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. The information content of NMR spectra is only superseded by X-ray crystallography. However, NMR spectra are usually recorded for substances in so-lution without needing to prepare crystals, rendering it much more suitable as a routine technique. In contrast to crystallographic structure determination, which often re-quires highly specialized training, interpretation of NMR spectra is considered a core skill and is introduced early in undergraduate chemistry cources [29]. Whenever or-ganic (and many inorganic) substances are synthesized in a modern lab, it is likely that NMR spectra are recorded, too. \nIn an NMR spectrometer (see Fig. 4), the sample is placed in a strong magnetic field (9.4T in a routine 400 MHz spectrometer), causing a net magnetization of the nuclear spins by the static field. Pulses from radio fre-quency coils, in resonance with the Larmor frequency of the nuclei, cause an oscillating transverse magnetization; measurement of the decaying response after completion of the pulse sequence leads to the NMR spectrum af-ter processing. Thus, NMR problems can be modelled through the time evolution of a system of nuclear spins, interacting with the external field, the oscillating pulses and among each other [30]. \nThe interaction with the molecule hosting the nuclei is mainly absorbed into two types of parameters: \n1. Nuclei in a molecule are diamagnetically shielded, leading to an energy splitting that is slightly differ-ent than that of a bare nucleus in the same mag-netic field. [31] Moreover, shielding experienced by nuclei differs within the same molecule, being influ-enced by functional groups, adjacent substituents and their relative arrangement in space. This effect is quantified through chemical shift values. Indeed, it is the chemical shifts that permit NMR to be used as an analytical tool for structure determination in the first place. \n2. Observable interactions between spins are due to indirect dipole-dipole couplings (J-couplings) be-tween spins, which are mediated by chemical bonds. These couplings are specific for the type and num-ber of bonds separating nuclei, thus providing valu-able structural information. \nA particularly common variant of NMR spectroscopy \nis 1H-NMR. Protons in molecules form systems of inter-acting spins with different chemical shifts, thus leading to a particularly complicated appearance of spectra. In practice, 1H spectra are usually assigned by identifying chemical shifts according to their characteristic values, and by analyzing coupling patterns, where possible. \nAlternatively, analysis of an NMR experiment can pro-ceed via its quantum mechanical simulation. Recent opinions in chemical and pharmaceutical publications ar-gue in favor of putting more emphasis on the rigorous simulation approach [32-34]. The size of the exact rep-resentation of the spin system scales exponentially with the number of spins. In order to set up the problem de-scription, values of the NMR parameters-chemical shifts and J-couplings are needed. These can either be fitted to the spectrum, typically in an iterative procedure re-quiring repeated spectrum simulation. Alternatively, the NMR parameters can be predicted, likely with some de-gree of deviation from experiment. Predicted values can also be used as a starting point for further refinement, or be combined with experimental parameters to substitute for missing values. \nOne important NMR application is structure deter-mination (see Fig. 5 (upper panel)), which is highly rel-evant both in academic and in industrial research: the structure of a molecule is unknown or uncertain. To elucidate the structure, it is necessary to assign NMR parameters such that they reproduce the experimental spectrum; at the same time, the values of the NMR pa-rameters need to be entirely consistent with, and not in contradiction to, the features of the proposed molecular structure. Moreover, there should be no other plausible structures that could also be in agreement with the exper-imental spectrum. To aid with structure determination, spectrum simulation can be coupled with computational NMR parameter prediction for proposed chemical struc-tures. \nAnother important NMR application is analysis of substance mixtures (see Fig. 5 (lower panel)), for ex-ample through quantitative NMR (qNMR). Important application areas include quality control, such as the pu-rity determination of pharmaceuticals; analysis of bioflu-ids, for example in metabolomics; or real-time monitor-ing of chemical or biological processes [35, 36]. In these cases, structures of target molecules are known in princi-ple, and often also their reference spectra. The goal is to determine substance concentrations, or the presence of impurities. Concentration determination through NMR is based on the principle that integrals over peaks in the spectrum are proportional to the number of resonating nuclei. In these applications, NMR often serves as an al-ternative or as a complement to mass spectrometry cou-pled with liquid or gas chromatography (e.g., GC/MS, LC/MS). \nApplying qNMR requires either spectra of reference compounds to be recorded, or libraries of reference spec-tra to be built, such as in the Human Metabolome Database [37]. Spectra of compounds depend on the \nstrength of the magnetic field specific to the spectrome-ter, but they can be recomputed if the NMR parameters are available. The NMR parameters themselves, espe-cially the chemical shifts, can be influenced by conditions such as solvent, temperature, concentration or pH value. For metabolomics, the GISSMO data base contains sets of spin parameters that have been fitted to experimental spectra for hundreds of compounds [38, 39]. \nFor the most NMR applications, typical NMR spec-trometers employ superconducting magnets to maintain high magnetic fields. Benchtop devices with lower fields generated by permanent magnets are becoming increas-ingly popular as a less expensive and more compact alter-native [40]. With field strengths of ca. 1 T to 2T, the ap-pearance of NMR spectra becomes profoundly more com-plicated, rendering accurate simulation even more useful for the analysis of such spectra. \nOur assessment of NMR simulation as an actual in-dustry problem is four out of five stars (★★★★★). The importance of nuclear magnetic resonance as an analyt-ical technique is beyond doubt. Realistic spectra can be calculated, subject to having or computing suitable NMR parameters. This use case does not receive the highest rating, since additional efforts are required to achieve a seamless integration of simulations within the established experimental analytical workflow. \n2. Transform to quantum \nA central part in the description of the NMR problem is the Spin Hamiltonian [30]: \nH = \nΣγκ (1 + δκ) ΒÎκ + 2πΣ JκικÎι. (1) \nk \nk>l \nIn this equation, B is the static magnetic field; the operator Îk = ħ⁻¹ŝk represents the spin of nucleus k, and yk is the gyromagnetic ratio of the respective iso-tope in vacuum. Chemical shifts de quantify the dia-magnetic shielding of each nucleus within the molecule. Values of chemical shifts are specified in parts per mil-lion (ppm), as the diamagnetic shielding is very weak: for example, chemical shifts of ¹H range within 30 ppm (the majority in a range of 12 ppm), those of 13C within 250 ppm. Indirect dipole-dipole coupling constants Jkl quantify the interaction between nuclei mediated through chemical bonds. These couplings are specific for the type and num-ber of bonds separating nuclei, thus providing valu-able structural information. \nThe Spin Hamiltonian presented above is sufficient for spin- nuclei of diamagnetic molecules in liquid state. Di-rect dipole interactions between nuclei cancel out due to molecular rotations occurring on a faster timescale than the NMR experiment, though they become important for macromolecules or solids. \n3. Get the job done without the quantum computer \nQuantum computing approaches to compute singlet-triplet gaps in diradicals can be benchmarked against either conventional general-purpose electronic structure methods or a custom RPA approximation designed at HQS Quantum Simulations for computing this particular property [122]. \nConventional methods include highly accurate and expensive methods based on the CASSCF reference (multireference methods): perturbation theory variants CASPT2 and NEVPT2, described above, as well as other multireference variants of coupled-cluster (MRCC) [123] and configuration interaction (MRCI) [124] theo-ries. A cheaper and way less robust alternative are spin-symmetry-broken (unrestricted) single-configurational methods (density functional theory [113]). \nAn RPA model for singlet-triplet gaps in diradicals developed at HQS [122] is based on the two-electrons-in-two orbitals model, which captures the most essential strong correlation in a diradical. The effect of empty and doubly occupied orbitals (dynamic correlation) is taken into account by RPA. In the static limit, direct RPA ap-proximation leads to the renormalization of the parame-ters of the two-orbital model. Electron interactions (one-and two-electron integrals) are taken from the minimum CASSCF-(2,2) conventional quantum chemistry calcu-lation. The computational price of such simulation is marginally larger than that of a single-configurational one, whereas the RPA correction has an exact analytic solution, adding practically no computational overhead. \nFigure 10 shows accuracy of our RPA approach as com-pared to the multireference methods as well as density functional theory (with B3LYP functional) in the unre-stricted (spin-symmetry-broken) variant. RPA performs on average better than density function theory methods and is commensurate with CASSCF-(2,2) based on the \nsame selected active space. However, CASSCF, and also NEVPT2, calculations with larger active spaces exhibit consistently better accuracy, at a price of larger compu-tational costs. \nWe rate this use case as two stars (★★★★★) since there is a wide selection of general conventional electronic structure methods varying in computational cost, accu-racy and robustness, as well as an efficient custom HQS developed RPA approach, demonstrating reasonable re-sults at moderate costs. There are still many steps that can be improved for classical calculations to achieve a better rating over time. \n4. Show quantum advantage \nWith Hamiltonian (14) we have constructed a mini-mal active space consisting of 2 electrons in 2 orbitals, resulting in four possible electronic states. This allows the electronic structure of the active space to be fully described by a 4 × 4 Hamiltonian matrix. The remaining orbitals, which are not part of the active space, have been transformed into bosonic modes using the random phase approximation, effectively modeling them as a bosonic bath. Consequently, the system can be described as a 4x4 electronic system coupled to a bosonic bath, analo-gous to the spin-boson model but with a four-level system instead of a two-level (spin) system. \nThe spin-boson model, where a two-level system is coupled to a bosonic bath, has been extensively stud-ied in the context of quantum computing and quantum simulation. Numerous approaches have been developed to solve its dynamics, including digital quantum simu-lation on platforms like IBM quantum computers, varia-tional quantum algorithms, and analog simulations using trapped ions or superconducting circuits. These methods address challenges such as modeling dissipative dynam-ics, handling strong system-bath coupling, and simulat-ing structured spectral densities [125, 126]. \nGiven the structural similarity between the spin-boson model and the 4x4 system coupled to a bosonic bath we have constructed, these established techniques should be adaptable to our situation. The primary difference lies in the dimensionality of the system (4x4 versus 2x2), which increases the complexity of the Hamiltonian but does not \nfundamentally alter the nature of the system-bath inter-action. Quantum algorithms, such as Trotterization or variational methods, can be extended to handle the larger Hilbert space of the 4x4 system, while analog platforms could be configured to represent four-level systems cou-pled to bosonic modes. \nOf course there are also differences to the existing work on the spin boson model. In the existing work, often well known bosonic spectral functions are being simu-lated. The spectral function for a molecule obviously looks quite different from an ohmic bath. So there are still many points to analyze. However, the key point of many of these efforts is that it is possible to map spin-boson model to a quantum processor with quite low depth, and this should also be the case in our situation. \nWhile this offers interesting opportunities, there is still a lot of work to be done to solve for the singlet triplet splitting within the random phase approximation on a quantum computer. Nonetheless, as compare to the di-rect approach using active space methods, we directly in-tegrate dynamic correlations in this approach, generate an extremly effective mapping to the quantum computer and are looking for energy differences in the spectrum of a Hamiltonian, instead of ground state properties. There-fore we rank the current probability to achieve quantum advantage for this use case at ★★★",

The rapid advancement of quantum computing research has led to the development of multiple hardware platforms, each with unique strengths and challenges. Among these, superconducting qubits have gained prominence due to their robust control schemes and compatibility with conventional microelectronics⁵. In the past several years, neutral-atom quantum computing (NAQC) has attracted significant attention for its inherent advantages, including scalability, high qubit connectivity, long coherence times, and superior gate fidelity⁶⁻⁸. \nIn superconducting quantum devices, such as IBM's heavy-hex architecture, qubits are sparsely arranged to minimize crosstalk. This sparse arrangement, however, requires additional routing steps (mainly through inserting SWAP gates) to facilitate operations between distant qubits. In contrast, NAQC devices, often arranged on a 2D grid, enable two-qubit gates between any two qubits by shuttling them closer. However, longer shuttling distances can increase noise levels. Thus, careful circuit compilation is critical on both platforms to achieve high circuit fidelity. \nThe Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a foundational component in many quantum algorithms, such as Shor's factoring algorithm¹, phase estimation', quantum simulation¹⁰, amplitude amplification¹¹, and the HHL algorithm for solving systems of linear equations¹². Despite its importance, implementing QFT efficiently on current quantum hardware represents a significant challenge. The QFT's all-to-all interaction pattern requires careful consideration of hardware-specific constraints, particularly in systems with limited qubit connectivity. Due to its core role in quantum computing, QFT optimization has been extensively studied in the literature, see¹³⁻²⁰. \nIn the realm of superconducting quantum devices, Maslov¹³ proposed a linear-depth transformation for QFT circuits on the linear nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, where qubits lie along a single path. Modern superconducting devices often feature more complex connectivity, making it challenging to identify a single Hamiltonian path that visits all qubits. Building on this foundational work, Jin et al.¹⁷ introduced efficient mapping techniques tailored to general 2D grid and IBM heavy-hex architectures. Focused on IBM's heavy-hex architecture, Gao et al. ¹⁹ proposed specifically optimized linear-depth transformations. \nFor NAQC devices, costly SWAP gates can be entirely replaced with atom movement (cf.²¹). While several compilation algorithms have been proposed²²⁻²⁵, they fail to produce optimal transformations. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarking tools to evaluate how close these generated transformations are to the optimal solutions. \nIn this work, we address these challenges by introducing optimal compilation strategies tailored to QFT circuits and NAQC \nError-detected coherence metrology of a dual-rail encoded fixed-frequency multimode superconducting qubit \nJames Wills,* Mohammad Tasnimul Haque, and Brian Vlastakis+ \nOxford Quantum Circuits, Thames Valley Science Park, Shinfield, Reading, United Kingdom, RG2 9LH \n(Dated: June 19, 2025) \nAmplitude damping is a dominant source of error in high performance quantum processors. A promising approach in quantum error correction is erasure error conversion, where errors are con-verted into detectable leakage states. Dual-rail encoding has been shown as a candidate for the conversion of amplitude-damping errors; with unique sensitivities to noise and decoherence sources. Here we present a dual-rail encoding within a single fixed-frequency superconducting multimode transmon qubit. The three island, two junction device comprises two transmonlike modes with a detuning of 0.75-1 GHz, in a coaxial circuit QED architecture. We show the logical bit-flip and phase-flip error rates are more than one order of magnitude lower than the physical error rates, and demonstrate stability and repeatability of the architecture through an extended measurement of three such devices. Finally, we discuss how the error-detected subspace can be used for investi-gations into the fundamentals of noise and decoherence in fixed-frequency transmon qubits. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nAmplitude damping as a result of energy relaxation is a significant source of error in superconducting qubits for use in quantum computing, characterized by the de-cay constant conventionally known as T₁. Significant research efforts exist to try to increase qubit T₁ via nanofabrication methods [1, 2], novel qubit designs such as fluxonium [3-5], and through engineering of the mi-crowave environment and Purcell filtering [6-10]. \nQuantum error correction exists as a method of reduc-ing errors in physical qubits via the redundant encod-ing of information across a large array of noisy physical qubits [11-14]. Whilst early demonstrations of surface codes have shown modest improvement in logical errors over physical error rates [15, 16], the hardware overheads required to sufficiently reduced errors to rates essential for useful quantum computation are dauntingly large. \nNovel encoding and error-detection mechanisms have been suggested to increase efficiency in error-correction protocols and reduce these hardware requirements. No-tably, erasure error-conversion [17, 18], defined by con-verting noise into heralded leakage states, has been the-oretically shown to have more favorable error thresholds [19-22]. As such, it may be possible to reach lower logical qubit error rates for the same number of noisy physical qubits. \nOne method of implementing an erasure error-conversion is dual-rail encoding, where quantum infor-mation is encoded across the subspace of two physical entities. This encoding has been demonstrated in su-perconducting quantum devices in both superconducting cavities [23-26], as well as flux tunable transmon qubits [27]. In each case, the encoding and error-detection pro-tocols show an improvement in the error-rates of the \nlogically encoded qubit compared to the physical con-stituents, demonstrating the viability of this architecture. \nIn this paper, we present an implementation of a dual-rail encoding in a fixed-frequency multimode transmon, within a coaxial circuit QED architecture. We demon-strate all-microwave control and readout of the logical qubit, utilizing an end-of-line error-detection protocol, and characterize idling error-rates of the encoded sub-space. The error-detected logical coherence metrics are shown to have an order of magnitude improvement in bit-flip and phase-flip error rates as compared to the con-stituent physical qubit modes. In addition, we show how the logical subspace can be used as a tool to probe the fundamentals of the noise and decoherence mechanisms in superconducting circuits. It is vital to understand these sources of error more deeply in order to achieve the goal of a fault tolerant quantum computer.",
    "answer": "`Dual-rail encoding` is a method of quantum error correction that encodes quantum information across the subspace of two physical entities, enabling `erasure error conversion`. In this technique, errors, particularly amplitude damping, are converted into detectable `leakage states`, allowing for their identification and post-selection, which can lead to lower logical qubit error rates.\n\nIn superconducting qubits, this encoding has been implemented in various devices, including multimode transmons. A multimode transmon, which consists of three superconducting islands and two Josephson junctions, provides an additional degree of freedom, enabling a second transmon-like mode. This allows for encoding a logical qubit in its single-excitation subspace, for example, mapping logical \\(|0_L\\rangle\\) to the \\(|10\\rangle\\) state and logical \\(|1_L\\rangle\\) to the \\(|01\\rangle\\) state of the two modes.\n\nKey to its error detection is the design principle that prevents direct single-photon decay between the \\(|01\\rangle\\) and \\(|10\\rangle\\) states due to different mode symmetries. Consequently, if amplitude damping occurs (e.g., either \\(|10\\rangle\\) or \\(|01\\rangle\\) decaying), the system transitions to the \\(|00\\rangle\\) state, which is outside the computational subspace. This \\(|00\\rangle\\) state acts as a detectable leakage state, effectively flagging that an error has occurred. This approach offers a fixed-frequency, hardware-efficient method for erasure error detection, simplifying calibration by negating the need for flux tuning or galvanic coupling. The result is an improvement in the error rates of the logically encoded qubit compared to the physical constituents, with logical bit-flip and phase-flip error rates observed to be more than one order of magnitude lower than their physical counterparts."

DUAL-RAIL ENCODING IN A FIXED \nFREQUENCY MULTI-MODE TRANSMON \nQUBIT \nWhere a conventional transmon qubit consists of two superconducting islands and one Josephson junction [28], the multimode transmon consists of three superconduct-ing islands, and two Josephson junctions [29]. This ad-ditional island and junction adds a degree of freedom to the circuit, and subsequently a second transmonlike mode. These devices have been widely explored for a number of use cases such as photon shot noise suppres-sion and tunable coupling [30-32], mode-selective cou-pling and entanglement generation [33-36], and Purcell protection and fast readout [37]. \nWe construct this device in a coaxial architecture [38-40], comprising of the multimode device, and lumped ele-ment resonator fabricated on opposite sides of a low loss dielectric substrate, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Control and readout signals are delivered by capacitively coupled coaxial lines above and below the device. In this imple-mentation, there is no galvanic coupling to the device or substrate, nor is there any requirement for flux tuning. In addition, the device, control, and readout circuitry occu-pies the same physical footprint of the conventional coax-ial qubit [29, 38], demonstrating the hardware-efficiency of this extensible architecture. \nThe device consists of two transmonlike modes we label as D and Q, due to the dipolelike and quadrupolelike polarisations of the electric fields that the modes best couple to respectively. We describe these modes as the physical modes of the system. \nThe Hamiltonian describing the circuit in the harmonic oscillator basis is given by, \nH \nħ \n2 \ni=D,Q \ni=D,Q \n(1) \nwhere wi is the transition frequency, aż is the anhar-monicity, and a at) is the annihilation (creation) operator for each mode i. The coupling between each mode is purely longitudinal with strength described by the cross-Kerr shift η. Since this device has two modes, it is known as a dimon [41, 42]. Each physical mode of the dimon behaves in the same way as a standard transmon, with transition frequencies and anharmonicities summarized in Table I. Each mode can be addressed via the same coaxial control line shown in Fig. 1 (a), and manipu-lated via a microwave signal. \nThe energy level diagram of the dimon is shown in Fig. 1 (a). The states are labeled by mn), corresponding to m(n) excitations in the D (Q) mode. We implement a dual-rail encoding by encoding a logical qubit in the single-excitation subspace of the energy level structure, such that a logical 0 (|0)L) corresponds to the (10) state, and a logical 1 (1)L) corresponds to the (01) state. No-tably, there is no direct single photon decay channel from the 01) state to the (10) state, due to the different sym-metries of the modes. We name this method of encoding, a dual-rail encoded dimon qubit (DDQ). \nAmplitude damping, or energy relaxation, will mani-fest as either the 10) or (01) state decaying to the (00) state, at a rate given by FD(Q) = 1/TD(Q), where TD(Q) is the energy relaxation time of the D (Q) mode. The dual-rail encoding converts this error to leakage outside of the logical subspace, described as an erasure error. Any detectable population of the |00) state will flag that an error has occurred. \nThe DDQ offers a fixed frequency approach to era-sure error detection within the same hardware-efficient physical footprint of the coaxial circuit QED architec-ture unit-cell. In addition, the need for flux tuning or galvanic coupling to the substrate that can introduce an unwanted noise source or crosstalk and additional cali-bration parameters is negated. \nâ \nAs shown in Fig. 1 (b), there is a lumped element LC resonator on the opposing side of the substrate. Due to the symmetry of the device, this resonator is transversely coupled to the Q mode of the dimon by a Hamiltonian term of the form ĤQR/ħ = gQR(+âQ)(a2+ân), where at is the annihilation (creation) operator of the readout resonator, and gQR is the transverse coupling strength. Whilst there is no direct coupling between the D mode and the resonator, it does inherit a state-dependent fre-quency shift due to the longitudinal coupling to the Q mode. In the dispersive limit (GQR « WR – WQ), the state-dependent frequency shifts XQ(D)R between the Q (D) mode and the readout resonator are given by, \nXQR ≈ QQ \nWR \nJQR \nWQ \n2 \nXDR≈7 (9QR2 ) \nWR \nWQ \n, \n(2) \nwhere WR is the frequency of the resonator, and 2XD(Q)R describes the full frequency shift of the resonator. \nWe perform an end-of-line (EOL) logical state distinc-tion, designed to maximally distinguish the three states",

ERROR-DETECTED COHERENCE \nMETRICS \nUsing our logical state manipulation and readout pro-tocols, we now characterize the logical error-rates of the DDQ: the bit-flip error rate, phase-flip error rate, and Ramsey coherence. \nThe logical bit-flip rate is characterized by the rate at which the 1)L population transfers to the (0) L state, and vice-versa. We measure this by preparing the DDQ in each of the two logical states, waiting for a delay time At, and performing an EOL logical state distinction readout, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (d). Using the readout classifier previously described in Section II, each mea-surement shot is classified into one of the three DDQ states. The logical bit-flip probability is calculated as, \n1 \nP(bit-flip) = (P(|1)z|init.|0)₁) + P(|0)z|init.|1))) \n2 \n(4) \nFollowing the methodology of [27], we measure P|1)L after initializing the DDQ in the 01) and 10) states, and plot the difference between the two error-detected \nstate populations as a function of measurement delay At, shown in Fig. 2 (d). \nWhere a conventional measurement of a superconduct-ing transmon qubit energy relaxation rate (or T₁ decay) typically shows an exponential decay, shown in Fig. 2 (a), the error-detected logical bit-flip measurement shows a more complex second-order type decay profile. At long time scales, in the absence of mid-circuit erasure error-checks, the logical bit-flip error is dominated by second order relaxation and subsequent re-excitation events. For short timescales relevant for algorithmic implementations and error-correction cycles, the decay profile can be ap-proximated to be linear. To obtain the short circuit depth bit-flip rate, we fit the decay up to 30 µs to a linear slope with constant offset to extract the logical bit-flip rate Γł, and define the error-detected logical qubit Tł = 1/Γ{. \nTo measure the logical phase-flip rate, we implement a Hahn-echo sequence. We prepare the dimon in the super-position state ) = (|01) + |10〉)/√2, wait a delay time At/2, apply a refocusing pulse, and project the state back to the logical Z axis after a second delay period of At/2, as shown in the pulse sequence in the inset of Fig. 2 (e). Once again, we perform a logical state distinction EOL measurement, and show the DDQ states as a function of delay time, At, in Fig. 2 (b). We show the postselected state probability P(|1)₁), along with the erasure fraction in Fig. 2 (e). \nAs with the bit-flip measurement, we observe a non-exponential decay in the error-detected measurement. The phase-flip error-rate for a circuit with short depth can be obtained by fitting the decay up to 30 µs with a linear decay. From this, we extract a logical phase-flip rate = 1/TE. We discuss the effect of noise sources on coherence further in Section IV. \nFinally, we measure the Ramsey coherence by prepar-ing the DDQ in a superposition state |/) = (101) + |10))/√2, allowing the state to evolve for time At, and projecting back onto the measurement axis, as shown in the pulse sequence in Fig. 2 (f). We add a virtual de-tuning of Af ≈ 75 kHz by modifying the phase, 6, of the final projection gate such that $ = 2π∆ft, inducing an oscillation between the (01) and ❘10) states.

    "context": "total repetitions each). Q2 and Q3 are measured simul-taneously, whilst Q1 is measured independently over a different 50 hour period. We show boxplots of the ex-tracted coherence parameters, TI, TE, and TR in Fig. 3 (Q3 Ramsey coherence was unable to be measured due to instability in one of the physical modes). \n2R \n= \nFrom these extended measurements, we extract me-dian values of T \n3.12 ms, T 2E = 0.76 ms, and \nTR = 0.07 ms, with individual DDQ device metrics shown in Table I. In Fig. 3, we also show the me-dian physical coherence parameters. The measured error-detected coherence metrics correspond to 48x improve-ments in bit-flip rates, 11x improvement in phase-flip rate, and 4x improvement in Ramsey coherence times. In addition to the qubit coherence metrics being greatly improved over a physical qubit, these metrics remain sta-ble over the course of the measurement period, as shown in Fig. 5 in Appendix B. Validating the reproducibility of the improved logical coherence metrics across multiple devices with a range of frequencies is a significant step to demonstrate the viability of the DDQ platform for future hardware integrations. \nIn addition to the error-detected coherence metrics, we measure the erasure rate, obtained from the (00) state population. This is indicated by the red trace, shown in Fig. 2 (d-f). We fit this to the form, \nAt \nP(100)) = (1 - exp(-Terature)) +D, (6) \nwhere 1/Terasure \nFerasure is the rate of leakage out \nof the computational subspace, and D is an offset due to erasure events occurring during the EOL readout. We show the extracted erasure rate, as well as physical mode relaxation rates in the time series plot in Fig. 5, and observe it qualitatively follows the same fluctuations, as expected. \nThe erasure rate is a important metric for dual-rail en-coded qubits, as it informs both the expected leakage rate during error-correction cycles, as well as sampling over-head in postselected quantum algorithm applications. \nIV. NOISE AND DECOHERENCE \nIn this implementation of dual-rail encoding, the co-herence of the logical qubit is affected by fluctuations in the detuning between the physical modes of the di-mon (δ∆ = δωρ – δωρ), in contrast to a conventional transmon qubit implementation where the coherence is sensitive to fluctuations in the transition frequency δω [28]. As such, the DDQ possesses unique sensitivities and insensitivities to physical noise sources. \nFor any such noise sources that cause a fluctuation in both wo and wp, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), the DDQ has a reduced sensitivity (or is entirely insensitive) to in terms of coherence. We describe these as common noise sources, and physical examples include charge noise [29], quasiparticle tunneling [44], and far-detuned two-levels systems (TLS) [45]. In each of these cases, the noise source fluctuates both dimon mode frequencies simulta-neously, such that A is small, or zero in perfectly sym-metrical cases. As such, if common noise sources were a dominating cause of decoherence in this device, we would expect to observe an increase in coherence of the DDQ in the logical subspace compared to the physical modes. \nWhere the coherence of the DDQ does possess a sensi-tivity is to what we describe as differential noise sources. These are noise sources that affect only one of the transi-tion frequencies of the dimon, as shown in Fig. 4 (b), such that δωρ ≠ δωρ. Examples of physical sources that can cause this kind of differential noise are frequency depen-dent control electronics noise, and nearly-resonant TLS [46-49]. \nIn the case of the DDQ, there are noise sources where the logical encoding gives a degree of protection of co-herence, but the asymmetry of the device means there is still some sensitivity. Two prominent examples of this are Josephson energy fluctuations due to critical current or dielectric noise, and resonator photon shot noise de-phasing [32]. For dephasing due to photon fluctuations in the resonator, we approximate the ratio of logical de-phasing (Γ) to average physical mode dephasing (phys) as, \nг \nΦ \nΦ \nδχ² (κ² + 4x2) \nphys² (к² + 48χ2) \n, \n(7) \nWhere X = (XQR + XDR)/2, and 8X = XQR - XDR. With the measured parameters, we estimate the logical encod-ing to result in a reduction in dephasing rate of 42%, 11% and 18%, for Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively. \nThe Josephson junctions are also a source of asym-metry in the fixed frequency DDQ architecture, since nanofabrication methods result in a statistical spread of junction parameters. By considering fluctuations in the detuning between the physical modes of the dimon, we calculate the dephasing rate Γ4 × Δ/ΘΕJ1,2 ≈ (1 - √r)/Δ, where r = EJ1/EJ2 is the ratio of the two junction energies. In the case of perfectly symmetrical junctions (EJ1 = EJ2), the DDQ is protected from fluc-tuations in junction energies, since both junctions par-ticipate equally in each mode of the dimon. From room temperature resistance measurements, we infer a junc-tion ratio of r = 0.963, 0.959 and 0.931, for Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively. \nIn both of these physical noise sources, the device can be further engineered with symmetry protection, through methods of symmetric qubit-resonator coupling and more favorable dx/X ratios for resonator photon shot noise dephasing protection, or Josephson junction fabri-cation postprocessing techniques [50-53] for critical cur-rent noise protection. We also postulate that increasing the coupling strength between the modes, and hence the detuning, A, reduces sensitivity to Josephson junction asymmetry, where post-fabrication tuning methods are not viable. \nTo further probe the dynamics of the Ramsey coher-ence measurements, we perform more detailed statistical analysis and methods of decoherence benchmarking [54] on the time series data of Q2. In Fig. 4 (c-f) we show the dynamics of the extracted frequency deviation from the mean oscillation frequency, ∆f, (c-d), and decay con-stants, T2R, (e-f) over the course of an extended set of repeated measurements. The logical qubit is measured independently over a separate time period, and the phys-ical mode measurements are interleaved with each other. In both the D-mode and logical qubit time series traces, we observe sudden jumps in frequency, which in the case of the logical qubit, align with drops in coherence. By contrast, we do not observe such jumps in the Q-mode traces, and the D-mode jumps do not correlate with drops in physical mode coherence. In previous studies, these jumps are attributed to TLS switching behavior, and of-ten identified by observing similar telegraph-like noise. In Fig. 4 (g-h), we show histograms of the extracted parameters T2R and Af – Af, for both the physical modes and the logical encoded qubit, from Fig. 4 (c-f). In the case of the exponential decay constant T2R, we see an improvement in the logical qubit coherence by factor",
    "answer": "The Dual-Rail Encoded Dimon Qubit (DDQ) system demonstrated significant coherence improvements over physical qubits: 48x in bit-flip rates, 11x in phase-flip rates, and 4x in Ramsey coherence times, with extracted median values of \\(T_1^L = 3.12\\) ms, \\(T_{2E}^L = 0.76\\) ms, and \\(T_{2R} = 0.07\\) ms. These metrics remained stable over extended measurement periods.\n\nDifferent noise sources affect the DDQ's coherence distinctly compared to conventional transmons:\n\n*   **Common Noise Sources:** DDQ exhibits reduced sensitivity or insensitivity to common noise sources like charge noise, quasiparticle tunneling, and far-detuned two-level systems (TLS), which cause simultaneous fluctuations in both dimon mode frequencies. This leads to an expected increase in DDQ coherence in the logical subspace compared to physical modes, as given by the logical dephasing to physical dephasing ratio \\(\\frac{\\Gamma_L}{\\Gamma_{phys}} \\approx \\frac{\\delta\\chi^2 (\\kappa^2 + 4\\chi^2)}{\\chi^2 (\\kappa^2 + 48\\chi^2)}\\).\n*   **Differential Noise Sources:** The DDQ's coherence can be sensitive to differential noise sources, which affect only one of the dimon's transition frequencies (e.g., \\(\\delta\\omega_D \\ne \\delta\\omega_Q\\)). Examples include frequency-dependent control electronics noise and nearly-resonant TLS. Josephson energy fluctuations due to critical current or dielectric noise, and resonator photon shot noise dephasing, are prominent examples where DDQ offers some protection, but retains some sensitivity due to device asymmetry.\n*   **Josephson Junction Asymmetry:** Statistical spread in Josephson junction parameters leads to asymmetry. While perfectly symmetrical junctions protect DDQ from fluctuations, real-world imperfections introduce dephasing. Increasing coupling strength between modes can reduce sensitivity to this asymmetry.\n\nDespite improvements in bit-flip and phase-flip rates, the Ramsey coherence did not show as dramatic an improvement, and the device's frequency stability remained largely unchanged. Observations of sudden frequency jumps, particularly in the logical qubit and D-mode, were attributed to TLS switching behavior, indicating persistent differential noise sensitivity."

    "question": "What classical expectation did the Stern-Gerlach experiment contradict regarding the measurement of atomic magnetic moments, and what quantum-mechanical observation did it reveal about electron spin angular momentum?",
    "context": "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm provides an early and illustrative example of quantum parallelism. It addresses the problem of determining whether a given function f: {0,1}^n -> {0,1} is either constant (f(x) is the same for all x) or balanced (f(x) is 0 for exactly half of the inputs and 1 for the other half). Classically, in the worst-case scenario, one would need to query the function 2^(n-1) + 1 times to distinguish between constant and balanced. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, however, achieves this distinction with just a single query to a quantum oracle U_f. The core of the algorithm involves preparing the input register in a uniform superposition using Hadamard gates, applying the quantum oracle, and then applying another set of Hadamard gates. A final measurement on the input register reveals the nature of the function with certainty. If the measurement outcome is all zeros, the function is constant; otherwise, it is balanced. This exponential speedup is a direct consequence of the quantum oracle evaluating the function for all 2^n possible inputs simultaneously.\n\nDescription of the Experiment \nWe now present a brief discussion of the Stem-Gerlach experiment, which is dis cussed in almost every book on modern physics. t First, silver (Ag) atoms are heated in an oven. The oven has a small hole through which some of the silver atoms escape. As shown in Figure 1.1, the beam goes through a collimator and is then subjected to an inhomogeneous magnetic field produced by a pair of pole pieces, one of which has a very sharp edge.\n\nWe must now work out the effect of the magnetic field on the silver atoms. For our purpose the following oversimplified model of the silver atom suffices. The silver atom is made up of a nucleus and 47 electrons, where 46 out of the 47 electrons can be visualized as forming a spherically symmetrical electron cloud with no net angular momentum. If we ignore the nuclear spin, which is irrelevant to our discussion, we see that the atom as a whole does have an angular momen tum, which is due solely to the spin-intrinsic as opposed to orbital-angular \nmomentum of the single 47th (5s) electron. The 47 electrons are attached to the nucleus, which is \"'--'2 x 105 times heavier than the electron; as a result, the heavy atom as a whole possesses a magnetic moment equal to the spin magnetic mo ment of the 47th electron. In other words, the magnetic moment /L of the atom is proportional to the electron spin S, \n/Lex S, (1.1.1) \nwhere the precise proportionality factor turns out to be e I mec ( e < 0 in this book) to an accuracy of about 0.2%. \nBecause the interaction energy of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field is just -J.l• B, the z-component of the force experienced by the atom is given by \na BBz Fz = -(/L. B)� /1-z-, az az \n(1.1.2) \nwhere we have ignored the components of B in directions other than the z direction. Because the atom as a whole is very heavy, we expect that the classical concept of trajectory can be legitimately applied, a point that can be justified us ing the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to be derived later. With the arrangement of Figure 1.1, the fl-z > 0 (Sz < 0) atom experiences a downward force, while the fl-z < 0 (Sz > 0) atom experiences an upward force. The beam is then expected to get split according to the values of fl-z· In other words, the SG (Stern-Gerlach) apparatus \"measures\" the z-component of /L or, equivalently, the z-component of S up to a proportionality factor. \nThe atoms in the oven are randomly oriented; there is no preferred direction for the orientation of J.l. If the electron were like a classical spinning object, we would expect all values of fl-z to be realized between IILI and -IILI· This would lead us to expect a continuous bundle of beams coming out of the SG apparatus, as indicated in Figure 1.1, spread more or less evenly over the expected range. Instead, what we experimentally observe is more like the situation also shown in Figure 1.1, where two \"spots\" are observed, corresponding to one \"up\" and one \"down\" orientation. In other words, the SG apparatus splits the original silver beam from the oven into two distinct components, a phenomenon referred to in the early days of quantum theory as \"space quantization.\" To the extent that /L can be identified within a proportionality factor with the electron spin S, only two possible values of the z-component of S are observed to be possible: Sz up and Sz down, which we call Sz+ and Sz-. The two possible values of Sz are multiples of some fundamental unit of angular momentum; numerically it turns out that Sz = h/2 and -h/2, where \nn = 1 .0546 X 10-2? erg-s \n= 6.5822 X w-16eV-s. \n(1.1.3) \nThis \"quantization\" of the electron spin angular momentum* is the first important feature we deduce from the Stern-Gerlach experiment.",
    "answer": "Classically, if the electron spin were like a continuous spinning object, one would expect a random orientation of its magnetic moment \\(\\mu\\), leading to a continuous spread of values for its z-component \\(\\mu_z\\) between \\(|\\mu|\\) and \\(-|\\mu|\\). This would result in a continuous bundle of beams after passing through an inhomogeneous magnetic field in the Stern-Gerlach (SG) apparatus. However, the Stern-Gerlach experiment experimentally observed a radical departure from this classical expectation. Instead of a continuous spread, only two distinct components, or \"spots,\" were observed, corresponding to an \"up\" and \"down\" orientation. This phenomenon, termed \"space quantization\" in early quantum theory, revealed that the z-component of the electron spin angular momentum (S) is quantized, taking on only two possible discrete values: \\(S_z = \\hbar/2\\) and \\(S_z = -\\hbar/2\\)."

We now introduce the notion of a bra space, a vector space \"dual to\" the ket space. We postulate that corresponding to every ket Ia) there exists a bra, denoted by (al, in this dual, or bra, space. The bra space is spanned by eigenbras { (a' l}, which correspond to the \neigenkets { Ia')}. There is a one-to-one correspondence between a ket space and a bra space: \nDC la)++(al \nI ' , DC ,, \na ),Ia ), ... ++(a J,(a J, ... \nDC Ia) + i,B)++(al + (,8 1, \n(1.2.9) \nwhere DC stands for dual correspondence. Roughly speaking, we can regard the bra space as some kind of mirror image of the ket space. \nThe bra dual to cia) is postulated to be c*(al, not c(al, which is a very impor tant point. More generally, we have \n( 1.2.1 0) \nWe now define the inner product of a bra and a ket. * The product is written as a bra standing on the left and a ket standing on the right; for example, \n(,Bia) = ((,Bi) · (ia)) . (1.2.11) \nbra(c)ket \nThis product is, in general, a complex number. Notice that in forming an inner product, we always take one vector from the bra space and one vector from the ket space. \nWe postulate two fundamental properties of inner products. First, \n(,Bia) = (ai,B)*. (1.2.12) \nIn other words, (,Bia) and (ai,B) are complex conjugates of each other. Notice that even though the inner product is, in some sense, analogous to the familiar scalar product a · b, (,Bia) must be clearly distinguished from (ai,B); the analogous distinction is not needed in real vector space because a · b is equal to b · a. Using (1.2.12) we can immediately deduce that (ala) must be a real number. To prove this just let (,8 I --+ (a 1. \nThe second postulate on inner products is \n(ala) � 0, (1.2.1 3) \nwhere the equality sign holds only if Ia) is a null ket. This is sometimes known as the postulate of positive definite metric. From a physicist's point of view, this postulate is essential for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, as will be apparent later.",

The question of the uniqueness of such an expansion will be postponed until we prove the orthogo nality of eigenkets. \nTheorem 1.1. The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator A are real; the eigenkets of A corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. \nProof. First, recall that \nAla') = a' Ia'). (1.3.1) \nBecause A is Hermitian, we also have \n(a\" IA = a\"* (a\" l, (1.3.2) \nwhere a', a\", ... are eigenvalues of A.

Let us now assume a' and a\" to be different. Because of the just -proved reality condition, the difference a' - a\"* that appears in (1.3.3) is equal to a' - a\", which cannot vanish, by assumption. The inner product (a\" Ia') must then vanish: \n(a\" Ia') = 0, (a' i= a\"), (1.3.5) \nwhich proves the orthogonality property (the second half of the theorem). \nWe expect on physical grounds that an observable has real eigenvalues, a point that will become clearer in the next section, where measurements in quantum mechanics will be discussed. The theorem just proved guarantees the reality of eigenvalues whenever the operator is Hermitian. That is why we talk about Her mitian observables in quantum mechanics. \nIt is conventional to normalize Ia') so that the { Ia')} form a orthonormal set: \n(a\" Ia') = 8a\"a'. ( 1.3.6) \nWe may logically ask, Is this set of eigenkets complete?

Actually the associative property is postulated to hold quite generally as long as we are dealing with \"legal\" multiplications among kets, bras, and operators.

    "question": "According to the quantum theory of measurement, how does performing a measurement on an observable \\(A\\) affect the state of a physical system, and what is the probabilistic interpretation of the measurement outcome?",
    "context": "Measurements \nHaving developed the mathematics of ket spaces, we are now in a position to discuss the quantum theory of measurement processes. This is not a particularly easy subject for beginners, so we first turn to the words of the great master, P. A. M. Dirac, for guidance (Dirac 1958, p. 36): \"A measurement always causes the system to jump into an eigenstate of the dynamical variable that is being mea sured.\" What does all this mean? We interpret Dirac's words as follows: Before a measurement of observable A is made, the system is assumed to be represented by some linear combination \n(1.4.1) \na' a' \nWhen the measurement is performed, the system is \"thrown into\" one of the eigenstates, say Ia'), of observable A. In other words, \nIa) A measurement Ia') . (1.4.2) \nFor example, a silver atom with an arbitrary spin orientation will change into either I Sz; +) or I Sz; -) when subjected to a SG apparatus of type SGz. Thus a measurement usually changes the state. The only exception is when the state is already in one of the eigenstates of the observable being measured, in which case \nIa') A measurement Ia') (1.4.3) \nwith certainty, as will be discussed further. When the measurement causes Ia) to change into Ia'), it is said that A is measured to be a'. It is in this sense that the result of a measurement yields one of the eigenvalues of the observable being measured. \nGiven (1.4.1), which is the state ket of a physical system before the measure ment, we do not know in advance into which of the various Ia') 's the system will be thrown as the result of the measurement. We do postulate, however, that the probability for jumping into some particular Ia') is given by \nProbability for a' = l (a' la) l 2 , (1.4.4) \nprovided that Ia) is normalized. \nAlthough we have been talking about a single physical system, to determine probability (1.4.4) empirically, we must consider a great number of measurements performed on an ensemble-that is, a collection-of identically prepared physical systems, all characterized by the same ket Ia). Such an ensemble is known as a pure ensemble. (We will say more about ensembles in Chapter 3.) A beam of silver atoms that survive the first SGz apparatus of Figure 1 .3 with the Sz component blocked is an example of a pure ensemble because every member atom of the ensemble is characterized by I Sz; +) . \nThe probabilistic interpretation (1.4.4) for the squared inner product I (a' Ia) 1 2 is one of the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics, so it cannot be proved. Let us note, however, that it makes good sense in extreme cases. Suppose the state ket is Ia') itself even before a measurement is made; then according to (1.4.4), the probability for getting a'-or, more precisely, for being thrown into la')-as the result of the measurement is predicted to be 1, which is just what we expect. By measuring A once again, we, of course, get Ia') only; quite gener ally, repeated measurements of the same observable in succession yield the same result.* If, on the other hand, we are interested in the probability for the system initially characterized by Ia') to be thrown into some other eigenket Ia\") with a\" i= a', then (1.4.4) gives zero because of the orthogonality between Ia') and Ia\"). From the point of view of measurement theory, orthogonal kets correspond to mutually exclusive alternatives; for example, if a spin � system is in 1 Sz; +), it is not in I Sz; -) with certainty. \nQuite generally, the probability for anything must be nonnegative. Further more, the probabilities for the various alternative possibilities must add up to unity. Both of these expectations are met by our probability postulate (1.4.4).",
    "answer": "According to the quantum theory of measurement, when an observable \\(A\\) is measured on a physical system, the system's state is caused to \"jump into\" one of the eigenstates of \\(A\\), say \\(|a'\\rangle\\). This implies that a measurement generally alters the system's state, unless the system was already in an eigenstate of the measured observable, in which case the outcome is certain and the state remains unchanged. The result of a measurement always corresponds to one of the eigenvalues of the observable.\n\nBefore a measurement, the system's state \\(|\\alpha\\rangle\\) is typically a linear combination of the eigenstates of \\(A\\): \\(|\\alpha\\rangle = \\sum_{a'} c_{a'}|a'\\rangle\\). The specific eigenstate \\(|a'\\rangle\\) into which the system is thrown cannot be predicted with certainty. However, if the initial state \\(|\\alpha\\rangle\\) is normalized, the probability of obtaining a particular eigenvalue \\(a'\\) as the measurement outcome (i.e., for the system to jump into the state \\(|a'\\rangle\\)) is given by \\(P(a') = |\\langle a'|\\alpha\\rangle|^2\\). This probabilistic interpretation is a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics.\n\nTo determine these probabilities empirically, measurements must be performed on a large collection (an ensemble) of identically prepared physical systems. This probabilistic postulate ensures that probabilities are non-negative and sum to unity across all possible outcomes, aligning with physical expectations. For instance, if a system is already in \\(|a'\\rangle\\), the probability of measuring \\(a'\\) is 1, and the probability of measuring any other eigenvalue \\(a''\\) (where \\(a'' \\neq a'\\)) is 0, due to the orthogonality of eigenkets."

In Section 1.1 we considered a Stem-Gerlach arrangement where we let only one of the spin compo nents pass out of the apparatus while we completely blocked the other component. More generally, we imagine a measurement process with a device that selects only one of the eigenkets of A, say Ia'), and rejects all others; see Figure 1.7. This is what we mean by a selective measurement; it is also called filtration because only one of the A eigenkets filters through the ordeal.

Schwinger has developed a formalism of quantum mechanics based on a thorough examination of selective measurements. He introduces a measurement symbol M(a') in the beginning, which is identical to Aa' or Ia') (a' I in our no tation, and deduces a number of properties of M(a') (and also of M(b',a') that amount to lb') (a' I) by studying the outcome of various Stem-Gerlach-type ex periments.

    "question": "In sequential Stern-Gerlach experiments, how does measuring the spin component along one axis (e.g., z-axis) destroy prior information about the spin component along a non-commuting axis (e.g., x-axis), and what is the classical analogy used to illustrate this peculiar quantum-mechanical behavior?",
    "context": "Sequential Stern-Gerlach Experiments \nLet us now consider a sequential Stem-Gerlach experiment. By this we mean that the atomic beam goes through two or more SG apparatuses in sequence. The first arrangement we consider is relatively straightforward. We subject the beam coming out of the oven to the arrangement shown in Figure 1 .3a, where SGz stands for an apparatus with the inhomogeneous magnetic field in the z-direction, as usual. We then block the Sz- component coming out of the first SGz apparatus and let the remaining Sz+ component be subjected to another SGz apparatus. This time there is only one beam component coming out of the second apparatus-just the Sz+ component. This is perhaps not so surprising; after all, if the atom spins are up, they are expected to remain so, short of any external field that rotates the spins between the first and the second SGz apparatuses. \nA little more interesting is the arrangement shown in Figure 1 .3b. Here the first SG apparatus is the same as before, but the second one (SGX:) has an inhomo geneous magnetic field in the x-direction. The Sz+ beam that enters the second apparatus (SGX:) is now split into two components, an Sx+ component and an \nSx- component, with equal intensities. How can we explain this? Does it mean that 50% of the atoms in the Sz+ beam coming out of the first apparatus (SGz) are made up of atoms characterized by both Sz+ and Sx+, while the remaining 50% have both Sz+ and Sx-? It turns out such a picture runs into difficulty, as we will see below. \nWe now consider a third step, the arrangement shown in Figure 1 .3c, which most dramatically illustrates the peculiarities of quantum-mechanical systems. This time we add to the arrangement of Figure 1 .3b yet a third apparatus, of the SGz type. It is observed experimentally that two components emerge from the third apparatus, not one; the emerging beams are seen to have both an Sz + compo nent and an Sz- component. This is a complete surprise because after the atoms emerged from the first apparatus, we made sure that the Sz- component was com pletely blocked. How is it possible that the Sz- component, which we thought, we eliminated earlier, reappears? The model in which the atoms entering the third apparatus are visualized to have both Sz+ and Sx+ is clearly unsatisfactory. \nThis example is often used to illustrate that in quantum mechanics we cannot determine both Sz and Sx simultaneously. More precisely, we can say that the selection of the Sx + beam by the second apparatus (SGx) completely destroys any previous information about Sz. \nIt is amusing to compare this situation with that of a spinning top in classical mechanics, where the angular momentum \nL=lw (1.1.4) \ncan be measured by determining the components of the angular-velocity vector w. By observing how fast the object is spinning in which direction, we can deter mine Wx, Wy, and Wz simultaneously. The moment of inertia I is computable if we \nknow the mass density and the geometric shape of the spinning top, so there is no difficulty in specifying both Lz and Lx in this classical situation. \nIt is to be clearly understood that the limitation we have encountered in deter mining Sz and Sx is not due to the incompetence of the experimentalist. We cannot make the Sz- component out of the third apparatus in Figure 1 .3c disappear by improving the experimental techniques. The peculiarities of quantum mechanics are imposed upon us by the experiment itself. The limitation is, in fact, inherent in microscopic phenomena.",
    "answer": "In sequential Stern-Gerlach experiments, measuring the spin component along one axis (e.g., \\(S_z\\)) and then subsequently measuring it along a non-commuting axis (e.g., \\(S_x\\)) irrevocably destroys the information obtained from the first measurement. For instance, if a beam is first filtered to select only \\(S_z+\\) atoms, and then this \\(S_z+\\) beam is passed through an \\(SG_x\\) apparatus, it splits into \\(S_x+\\) and \\(S_x-\\) components with equal intensities. A surprising peculiarity arises when this \\(S_x\\)-filtered beam is then passed through a third \\(SG_z\\) apparatus: both \\(S_z+\\) and \\(S_z-\\) components reappear, even though the \\(S_z-\\) component was previously eliminated. This demonstrates that the \\(SG_x\\) measurement completely erases any prior information about \\(S_z\\).\n\nThis behavior highlights a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics: non-commuting observables (like \\(S_z\\) and \\(S_x\\)) cannot be determined simultaneously with arbitrary precision. This limitation is inherent to microscopic phenomena and not due to experimental inadequacy. A classical analogy is a spinning top: classically, all components of its angular momentum (\\(L_x, L_y, L_z\\)) can be measured simultaneously. However, this classical intuition fails for quantum spin, where the act of measuring one component perturbs the system such that information about non-commuting components is lost."

    "question": "How does the phenomenon of light polarization, particularly with sequential Polaroid filters, provide an analogy for the behavior observed in sequential Stern-Gerlach experiments, and what mathematical implication arises for representing quantum-mechanical spin states?",
    "context": "Analogy with Polarization of Light \nBecause this situation looks so novel, some analogy with a familiar classical situ ation may be helpful here. To this end we now digress to consider the polarization of light waves. This analogy will help us develop a mathematical framework for formulating the postulates of quantum mechanics. \nConsider a monochromatic light wave propagating in the z-direction. A linearly polarized (or plane polarized) light with a polarization vector in the x-direction, which we call for short an x-polarized light, has a space-time dependent electric field oscillating in the x-direction \nE = Eox cos(kz - wt). (1.1.5) \nLikewise, we may consider a y-polarized light, also propagating in the z-direction, \nE = Eoy cos(kz - wt). (1.1.6) \nPolarized light beams of type ( 1.1.5) or ( 1.1.6) can be obtained by letting an un polarized light beam go through a Polaroid filter. We call a filter that selects only beams polarized in the x-direction an x-filter. An x-filter, of course, becomes a y filter when rotated by 90° about the propagation (z) direction. It is well known that when we let a light beam go through an x-filter and subsequently let it impinge on a y-filter, no light beam comes out (provided, of course, that we are dealing with 100% efficient Polaroids); see Figure 1 .4a. \nThe situation is even more interesting if we insert between the x-filter and the y-filter yet another Polaroid that selects only a beam polarized in the direction which we call the x' -direction-that makes an angle of 45° with the x-direction in the xy-plane; see Figure 1 .4b. This time, there is a light beam coming out of the y-filter despite the fact that right after the beam went through the x-filter it did not have any polarization component in the y-direction. In other words, once the x' -filter intervenes and selects the x' -polarized beam, it is immaterial whether the beam was previously x-polarized. The selection of the x' -polarized beam by the second Polaroid destroys any previous information on light polarization. Notice that this situation is quite analogous to the situation that we encountered earlier with the SG arrangement of Figure 1 .3b, provided that the following correspon dence is made: \nSz ± atoms*+ x-, y-polarized light \nSx ± atoms*+ x' -, y' -polarized light, \nwhere the x'- and y\n' -axes are defined as in Figure 1 .5. \n(1.1.7) \nIn the triple-filter arrangement of Figure 1 .4b, the beam coming out of the first Polaroid is an x-polarized beam, which can be regarded as a linear combination of an x' -polarized beam and a y' -polarized beam. The second Polaroid selects the x' -polarized beam, which can in tum be regarded as a linear combination of an x-polarized and a y-polarized beam. And finally, the third Polaroid selects the y-polarized component. \nApplying correspondence (1.1.7) from the sequential Stem-Gerlach experi ment of Figure 1 .3c to the triple-filter experiment of Figure 1 .4b suggests that we might be able to represent the spin state of a silver atom by some kind of vector in a new kind of two-dimensional vector space, an abstract vector space not to be confused with the usual two-dimensional (xy) space. Just as x and y in (1.1.8) are the base vectors used to decompose the polarization vector x' of the x' -polarized light, it is reasonable to represent the Sx+ state by a vector, which we call a ket in the Dirac notation to be developed fully in the next section. We denote this vector by ISx;+) and write it as a linear combination of two base vectors, ISz;+) and I Sz;-), which correspond to the Sz + and the Sz- states, respectively. So we may conjecture \n(1.1.9a) \n(1.1.9b) \nin analogy with (1.1.8). Later we will show how to obtain these expressions using the general formalism of quantum mechanics. \nThus the unblocked component coming out of the second (SGx) apparatus of Figure 1 .3c is to be regarded as a superposition of Sz+ and Sz- in the sense of (1.1.9a). It is for this reason that two components emerge from the third (SGz) apparatus. \nThe next question of immediate concern is, How are we going to represent the Sy± states? Symmetry arguments suggest that if we observe an Sz± beam going in the x-direction and subject it to an SGy apparatus, the resulting situation will be very similar to the case where an Sz ± beam going in the y-direction is subjected to an SGx apparatus. The kets for Sy ± should then be regarded as a linear combination of ISz;±), but it appears from (1.1.9) that we have already used up the available possibilities in writing ISx;±). How can our vector space formalism distinguish Sy ± states from Sx ± states? \nAn analogy with polarized light again rescues us here. This time we consider a circularly polarized beam of light, which can be obtained by letting a linearly polarized light pass through a quarter-wave plate. When we pass such a circu larly polarized light through an x-filter or a y-filter, we again obtain either an x-polarized beam or a y-polarized beam of equal intensity. Yet everybody knows that the circularly polarized light is totally different from the 45°-linearly polar ized (x' -polarized or y' -polarized) light. \nMathematically, how do we represent a circularly polarized light? A right cir cularly polarized light is nothing more than a linear combination of an x-polarized \nlight and a y-polarized light, where the oscillation of the electric field for the y polarized component is 90° out of phase with that of the x-polarized component:* \nE = Eo [�x cos(kz - wt) + �ycos (kz - wt\n+ �)] . \nIt is more elegant to use complex notation by introducing € as follows: \nRe(€) = Ej Eo. \nFor a right circularly polarized light, we can then write \n€ = [ 1\nxe\ni kz wt) + \ni_ye\ni kz wt ] v'2 v'2 ' \nwhere we have used i = e\nin 12\n. \n(1.1.10) \n(1.1.11) \n(1.1.12) \nWe can make the following analogy with the spin states of silver atoms: \nSy + atom *+ right circularly polarized beam, \n(1.1.13) \nSy - atom *+ left circularly polarized beam. \nApplying this analogy to (1.1.12), we see that if we are allowed to make the coefficients preceding base kets complex, there is no difficulty in accommodating the Sy± atoms in our vector space formalism: \n(1.1.14) \nwhich are obviously different from (1.1.9). We thus see that the two-dimensional vector space needed to describe the spin states of silver atoms must be a complex vector space; an arbitrary vector in the vector space is written as a linear combi nation of the base vectors I Sz; ±) with, in general, complex coefficients. The fact that the necessity of complex numbers is already apparent in such an elementary example is rather remarkable.",
    "answer": "The behavior of sequential Stern-Gerlach (SG) experiments is analogous to experiments with sequential Polaroid filters for light polarization. If unpolarized light passes through an x-filter, then a y-filter, no light emerges. However, if a 45°-oriented filter (x'-filter) is inserted between the x-filter and y-filter, light *does* emerge from the y-filter. This is because the x'-filter selects x'-polarized light, destroying the prior information that the light was x-polarized. The x'-polarized light can be decomposed into x- and y-polarized components, and subsequent filtration by the y-filter acts on this new polarization state.\n\nThis analogy is mapped to the SG experiment as follows:\n- \\(S_z \\pm\\) atoms correspond to x- and y-polarized light.\n- \\(S_x \\pm\\) atoms correspond to x'- and y'-polarized light.\n\nJust as \\(x'\\)-polarized light can be expressed as a linear combination of \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-polarized light (e.g., \\(E_{0x'} = E_0 [\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\hat{x} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\hat{y}] \\cos(kz - \\omega t)\\)), the \\(S_x+\\) spin state is conjectured to be a linear combination of \\(S_z+\\) and \\(S_z-\\): \\(|S_x;+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|S_z;+\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|S_z;-\\rangle\\).\n\nThe analogy extends to circularly polarized light, which can be represented as a linear combination of x- and y-polarized light with a 90° phase difference (e.g., \\(E_0 [\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\hat{x} \\cos(kz - \\omega t) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\hat{y} \\cos(kz - \\omega t + \\frac{\\pi}{2})]\\)). This suggests that the spin states along the y-axis, \\(|S_y;\\pm\\rangle\\), are represented by complex coefficients: \\(|S_y;+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|S_z;+\\rangle + i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|S_z;-\\rangle\\).\n\nTherefore, the two-dimensional vector space required to describe the spin states of silver atoms must be a `complex vector space`, where arbitrary state vectors are written as linear combinations of base vectors with complex coefficients. This inherent necessity for complex numbers is a remarkable feature of quantum mechanics, even in elementary examples."
